"Error: “chromedriver” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified." <br>
(I tried this on MacOS - was be ok.)

        > Open terminal
            1.Navigate to path where your chromedriver file is located
            2.Execute any one of the below commands
            3.Command1: xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <name-of-executable>
            
            Example
            
            /usr/local/Caskroom/chromedriver 
            $ xattr -d com.apple.quarantine chromedriver 
            (or)
            
            Command2: spctl --add --label 'Approved' <name-of-executable>

            Note: This will work only with the file(s) where the above command is executed. 
            If a new chromedriver is downloaded then the command has to be executed 
            again on the newly downloaded file
